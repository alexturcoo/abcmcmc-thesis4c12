# Approximate Bayesian Computation Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method (ABC-MCMC) and Low Complexity Regions

Low complexity regions (LCRs) are sequences of DNA or Amino Acids that have a biased composition that differ from the normal complexity of DNA or Protein sequences. LCRs are characterized by their low entropy and lack of diversity and are known to play critical roles in many biological contexts.

For my undergraduate thesis in Biology at McMaster University, I programmed an ABC-MCMC using C++ to predict evolutionary parameters associated with LCRs in order to better understand how these regions form. These regions tend to have extremely high mutation rates and are known to be evolutionarily relevant in the context of human development.
