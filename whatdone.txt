1. Created function which takes an integer value and generates a  
random amino acid sequence of that length (I used the string class
from c++ for this part) - string class allows for easy string
manipulation compared to using "an array of chars in c)                                         


std::string createSeq(int n){

    char aminoAcids[numAA] = { AMINO ACID SYMBOLS };

    std::string protein = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        protein =  protein + aminoAcids[rand() % numAA];}

    std::cout << protein << "\n" << "\n" ;
    //printf("%s", protein.c_str());
    return protein;
}

2. The second function I began working on reads in the SRP40
protein which acts as the data that is already known, and it
creates a vector with characteristics like the length of the
sequence, the number of LCR's in the sequence, average entropy of
the LCRs - we must use segA to determine these characteristics.
- in C, we need to figure out how to call segA and record the value
  of the output and manipulate the value of the output as well (SEP
19 2022)
- I have created a symbolic link to the program segA and I will use
  that when I call segA from c/c++. (SEP 19 2022)
- Converted srp40 protein string into fasta file, fed that fasta file to segA, figured out how many low complexity regions are in the srp40 protien sequence (SEP 20 2022)

3. I created a repository on github so I could work both from home
and from the lab and push changes on both different devices (SEP 19
2022)
- always need to remember to push the changes from where I am
  working - once segA is involved, the code will only work when
running on the server

####################################################################################################
4. The third function I am working on is the function responsible for mutating the randomly generated protein sequence (SEP 21)
- Basically I need it to iterate through each amino acid in the generated sequence and choose a random exponential deviate from the
  exponential distribution (which models waiting times between events). Once I have generated a random exponential deviate for each amino
acid in the simulated sequence, I have to select the amino acid with the lowest value and select that amino acid to mutate into another
amino acid - I repeat this process of iterating through the sequence and assigning exponential deviates and mutating the lowest value for
a lot of generations (Brian suggested 1000 generations for 100 Amino acid sequence).
- Need to figure out a way to store the deviates in the same positions as amino acids so when we find the lowest number it matches the
  amino acid position

- SEPT 22 - Today I figured out that using a c++ vector is better
than using an array because arrays in c cant change size at runtime.
Vectors on the other hand can change size at runtime so we can add
values to it while iterating through the loop - today I just used
the rand() function because I could not get ran1 working for the
exponential deviates - I have basically intialized a vector,
iterated through the length of the simulated amino acid sequence and
produced a random number for that position in the amino acid - I
store these random values in a vector which is also 0 indexed and
matches the indices of the amino acid string.

std::string mutateSeq(std::string simulated_protein){

    std::vector<double> exp_deviates_vtr ; // Creating a vector to hold the values of the deviates

    // Traversing the string
    for (int i = 0; i < simulated_protein.length(); i++) {

        // Code to apply random exponential deviates to AA
        int deviate =  rand();
        exp_deviates_vtr.push_back(deviate);
    }

    // THIS IS JUST TO PRINT THE VECTOR
    for (int x = 0; x < exp_deviates_vtr.size(); i++) {
        std::cout << x << ' ';
    }
    

    return simulated_protein;
}

5. SEPT 26 2022 - SO, mutation function got split up today into kind of 2 separate parts. Basically, we will not choose exponential deviates for
mutation, but rather choose a random poisson deviate with a mean equal to (mutation rate * # of sites) - choosing a random value from this
distribution could yield the same # of mutations as the mean, or more or less. Then we assign mutations randomly to the number of amino acids that we
get from this poisson distribution deviate. The second function will be created in order to handle amino acid expansion, and in this step we will use
exponential deviates - breaking the process up like this will save time. SIDE NOTE: We are using a poisson distribution because any kind of rare event
(like mutation rate) can be modeled by this. We will keep the function from above but modify it slightly - it will be the function that does the amino
acid expansion part
- I think I finished the function responsible for mutating the
sequence (choosing the number of mutations from a poisson
        distribution with a mean equal to the mutation rate * length
        of the sequence) - I just need to now get ran1 and the
poisson distribution in there because I am using rand() right now to
generate the sequences - CHECK ON THIS ASAP - the only thing I have
done is basically make a loop which uses the number of mutation
sites provided by the rand() function between 1-10 and changes that
- STILL WORKING ON FUNCTION TO LOOK BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN AMINO
ACID SEQUENCE TO CHECK FOR REPEATS AND ASSIGN DEVIATES (SEPT 26
        2022)

- SEPT 27 2022 - Updated code for the second mutation function.
Today I attempted to write the function which iterates through the
mutated protein sequence and assigns exponential deviates
(mutateSeqExp). Right now, the code looks for matching amino acids both upstream and
downstream the protein and the number of repeats is assessed per
amino acid. This means each amino acid is iterated through and the
same amino acids are looked for on either side of the amino
acid. The length of the repeat is then used in subsequent steps
like solving for beta = (mutation rate, length of repeat) and then
this beta value is used in the exponential distribution as the mean
- TRY TO FIND A WAY TO REMOVE BOTH COUNTERS AND JUST USE 1 COUNTER
IN mutateSeqExp - issue with counters getting incorrect values, fix
this.
- Today I also coded in the ability to scan for repeats (part 2 of the mutation function) - it is able to assign amino acids within repeats a longer length value than individual amino acids
which are not within repeats - this means we will be able to assign a random exponential deviate with a mean equal to the mutation rate times the length of the repeats. I am still having
issues with the random number generation and distribution functions, need to solve this ASAP (SEPT 27 2022)
- QUESTION (wrote in notebook as well), need to think about it - What does a larger mean, mean in terms of the exponential distribution? If I am saying to multiply the mutation rate by
the length of the repeats, this would mean a larger beta value going in as the mean of the exponential deviate, does a larger mean make a random number that will be small more likely?

- OCTOBER 3 2022 - Today I finally figured out how to implement Ran1 into my code. I have both the file that brian sent me "myRandomFunctions.c" which utilizes functions from the second edition of
  Numerical Recipes. Brian also gave me the third edition of the book which includes a newer random number generator called Ran - this one can be used as well to generate the deviates, I just need
to add the functions from numerical recipes thrid edition into the file called "functions.cpp" - I still need to add random deviate functions for normal distribution (to choose new mutation rates),
for exponential deviate function (for amino acid extension function), and poission deviates (to choose how many mutations to give my simulated protein per generation)
- So I used the functions from Numerical recipes third edition, I am trying to now test out using the poisson deviates and exponential deviates. The poisson deviates kept giving me 0 as an int
  because it was a float number but for a number of mutations should I be rounding the nearest whole number? Do I use floats or ints? I should not be getting such low numbers for my poisson deviate,
my poisson deviate is supposed to tell me how many mutations the sequence should undergo and right now I cant even get 1 mutation. FIGURE THIS OUT


//THIS FUNCTION WILL CHOOSE A RANDOM POISSON DEVIATE WITH A MEAN

    //This for loop will give 5 random sites mutations
    for (int i = 0; i < poisson_deviate_num_mutations; i++) {

        char aminoAcids[numAA] = { 'G', 'A', 'L', 'M', 'F', 'W', 'K', 'Q', 'E', 'S', 'P', 'V', 
                                   'I', 'C', 'Y', 'H', 'R', 'N', 'D', 'T' };
        
        char random_AA = aminoAcids[rand() % numAA]; // sets up the random amino acid, same used in first function to createSeq
        int random_site = rand() % simulated_protein.length(); // Gives random number in range (0 - length of protein sequence)
        simulated_protein[random_site] = random_AA; // indexes the simulated protein at a random spot and replaces the existing AA with a new random one
    }

November 2 2022 - Things have been busy recently, but today I separated all
of my functions that were in one file, into their own respective file. I will also
create a Makefile to compile each of the functions for initial testing.
- createseq.cpp works on its own and produces a random sequence of amino acids - this is using the c++ rand, I think its okay in this case
- observed_protein.cpp function is still in the works but it works on its own and will be the vector of summary statistics for the observed data (srp40 right now)
- mutations.cpp contains both functions which will be used in the mutation step - I have got the first part working where a random poisson deviate is selected and
  that number is the number of amino acids to mutate - this step works, now I have to get the second function with the exponential deviates to work. (Updated code
on github) - exponential deviates part is working, just having difficulty generating random exponential deviates on each iteration of the loop. I get the same
value of exponential deviate for individual residues and the same value of exponential deviate for residues part of a repeat, run the code for mutations.cpp to
check it out - get some help with this.

November 3 2022 - Still trying to get different random deviates in mutations.cpp program. When I run it I am getting the same deviates for individual residues and the
same deviates for repeats part of a bunch of repeats. It is very weird. I am talking to Brian about the issue today in our meeting.
- After meeting with Brian, he basically figured that using time was not working as a way to get different seeds on each iteration of the loop, we instead used
  myran.int64() as the argument for the seeds of the exponential deviates and now we have different deviates for each amino acid!!!1 SO HYPE LETS GO

November 7 2022 - today I am working on adding to the mutations.cpp code. What I need to do is first select the lowest exponential deviate which represents the amino acid
that is going to change the quickest. Then, at that site we either insert or remove a repeat. To do this we will have Ran select a random number between 0 and 1, and
if the number is less than 0.5, we do a deletion of the site and if the random number is larger than 0.5, we insert another of the same amino acid.
- added a function called getIndex which grabs the index of the lowest number in the vector by supplying it with the vector and the value and it will find the
  index. 
- Next I am adding code to generate a random number between 0 and 1 and if its less than 0.5, deletion and if its larger than 0.5 insertion - is this where indel
  rate comes up?
QUESTION
- need to figure out where to set indel rate... I have already set a mutation rate but I do not know where to add the indel rate... is it set at the part where we
generate a random number and see if its less than or greater than 0.5? Talk to Brian - okay the answer for this is that we run once through with the mutation rate,
and once through with the indel rate... lets see how that works lol

November 8 2022 - Today before my c++ test, I wrote some code to select the lowest deviate and either insert or delete an amino acid based on a random number
generated between 0 and 1. - the code ended up working and I am so so happy. At this point, my mutations.cpp program will first take an amino acid sequence,
generate a single random possion deviate from a poisson distribution with mean = protein.length*mutation.rate. This gives us the number of amino acids to mutate and
at random, that number of amino acids are mutated. The program then has a function which scans for repeats and inserts or deletes a repeat where the lowest exponential deviate was
assigned.

November 9 2022 - Today I spent the day figuring out how to call seg and find the average entropy of the observed protein sequence srp40. The way in which I did this was using
a system call to segA with the chosen parameters, then using awk, and grep I manipulated the output to only get the complexity values and then I added these values up and
divided by the number of values to get the average entropy of the LCRs. I will drop some cool commands that I used here, just taking a break.
 
 system("segA srp40.fasta 15 1.9 2.2 -l | grep 'complexity' | awk '{print $2}' | egrep -o '([0.0-9.0]+)' | awk '{sum += $1} END {print mean=sum/NR}' >> avg_entropy_lcrs.txt");

This command essentially grabs the output of segA and outputs the mean avg entropy of the LCRs. Basically it finds where the output has complexity
in it and from here we grab all the numbers, add them up, nad divide them by how many numbers there were to get an average entropy. Cool command

November 10 2022 - Today is my meeting with Brian. I have been doing alot of work on finding out which distance measure to use to find the
difference in the vectors of summary statistics. This paper is a good one for showing the complete algorithm of an ABC with a weighted distance
measure. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1449703/#eqn1 - First we need to find an appropriate way to store the vectors of summary
statistics in order to successfully calculate the euclidean distance.
- After talking to Brian, he confirmed that I should use euclidean distance to calculate the distance between the vector of both summary statistics. 
I still need to ask him about normalizing the vector because some values are super large
- Brian also suggested I follow the Hamilton Paper and attempt to calculate weighted values the same way they did in this paper. What this entails is running a linear regression
and then pulling the R^2 value and using that to calculate the weight. This calculation is done after simulating over numerous generations. Also the paper first did this in a way that
did not use weights and then they used weights to show how it improved it, maybe I could do the same but GET IT WORKING WITHOUT WEIGHTS FIRST.
- I took a function from online which calculates the euclidean distance between two vectors which works. In order to better understand this I am also going to try to get this calculation 
working with some of my own code!! - HAHAHHA I DID IT LETS GOO AMD ITS SO MUCH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THAN THE OTHER CODE I TOOK FROM THE INTERNET
- Now that I have the euclidean distance calculation working I need to go and put the values I got in observed_protein.cpp and store them in vectors so my distance function will work on them.
- successfully stored the values of the observed protein in a std::vector<double> which is awesome because now once I get the simulated protein std::vector<double of summary statistics my function
uses vectors of the double type so we will be able to calculate distance. 
- The next thing I am going to do is write a separate function to store the summary statistics of the simulated protein. I made a new file which basically returns the same vector as the observed
protein function. I now have a way to store the summary statistics for both observed and simulated data, AND a way to calculate the euclidean distance between those values!!
- The next thing I started doing was assembling the abcmcmc.cpp file which is the main file that will connect all of the functions I created in different files. Basically I linked all the files to
abcmcmc.cpp and now I am using the functions I made in that file, where I will write the algorithm now for an abc mcmc - we also need to think about the linear regression aspects to get the weights
that we can use for the distances because right now we have no weights when calculating the distance. We still need to do some tests and try to calulate the distance for  some vectors I produce with my
code! For today, I am stopping, uploading all this to github. ALSO A LITTLE SIDE NOTE FOR YOURSELF XANDER - GOOD NOTES ARE ON YOUR IPAD
- Servers went down for a btit, back on it


November 14 2022 - Over the weekend I worked on getting a theme for a latex beamer presentation, have to start updating some of the
intro and background slides, but also NEED RESULTS
- Today I am going to focus on getting this algorithm down pat because right now it is sketchy in my head. Let's solidify this so on
  thurday we can go over it with Brian. 
- Pretty confused on this whole linear regression thing for the weighting of the euclidean distance. I think I will first have to try
  and run this without weigting euclidean distance. I am struggling to understand this; if you choose 0.001 as your tolerance, how does
setting your distance to being less than this give you only 1000 points? Im kinda confused and tired now, bad day Im gonna go, need to
talk to brian tmrw

November 15 2022 - Today I talked to Brian about some of the issues I was having from yesterday
- He helped me come up with a way to modify the ABC algorithm from Marjoram to just accept or reject based on the euclidean distance.
- Brian also said that I should change the poisson deviate mutation part to exponential deviates for indel rate and mutation rate. Basically
  what this means is take the minimum exponential deviate out of both the exponential deviates based on mutation rate and the exponential
deviates based on indel rate.
- First what I am going to try and do today is fix the mutation function and then try to put together the algorithm without the weights right
  now. I hope I can get it to work 
- In a file called mutations2.cpp, I will try to remake the existing mutation function but with exponential deviates for everything, no more
  poisson. OK so the way this is going to work is basically we will run through the sequence and assign an exponential deviate with a mean equal to the mutation rate for all the amino acids in the
sequence. Then we will iterate through the sequence again and scan for repeats and assign deviates based on the indel rate. Once we have two vectors full of deviates, we choose the lowest one and
depending on which vector it comes from (mutation or indel) we either mutate that lowest deviate site or insert or delete that site.
- Ok so I fixed the mutation function to basically assign deviates based on both mutation rate and indel rate. It is working based on some tests of running it on its own
- we also added this new code to the algorithm file and it works.
- I also got the vectors for both observed and simulated proteins in my abcmcmc.cpp code and this works and also my distance calculation works!!!! Now time to fix up the parameter values
  and get this loop going for mutations and the simulation as a whole
 -Remember to propose a new value for a parameter lets use the normal distribution! - Updates coming soon.
- Final update for the day, I fixed the mutation function the way Brian told me to change it with the vectors, might be inefficient but good. I also started messing around heavy in my
  abcmcmc file playing around with looping the mutation function over time. It seems to be working I will do more tests tomorrow but I am happy I got something going.

Things to aim for next - adding a loop to propose new parameter values, calculating 10 summary statistic vectors per parameter and averaging that before checking the distance. Although we
do not have weights and we are kind of skipping step 4 in Marjorams ABC-MCMC algorithm steps, it should still give me decent results. Much more to come.

NOVEMBER 17 2022 - Today is my weekly meeting with Brian. 
- Will let him know I changed the mutation function to use exponential deviates based on both mutation and indel rates and select the lowest of both and either mutate or insert/delete accordingly
- QUESTION: Models - What are the models we are using for indel and mutation rates? Stepwise Model IDK
- ANSWER - The model we are using for mutation is just uniform where the exponential deviate is only dependent on the mutation rate. In the case of indels, deviate is dependent on the length of the
  repeat, multiplied by the indel rate. These are the two models
- QUESTION: Are accepted paramters producing the posterior distribution? Just Need to check this - Still need to check this
- QUESTION: How can I move to the new parameter value with a certain probability if I dont calculate h=min(1, large equation)
- ANSWER We are just going to use distance as the probability right now.
- QUESTION: What should I set initial indel and mutation rates to? - did not ask this

Today I am going to try to add an if statement to see if the distance satisfies the threshold condition. - Did not get to this today

NOVEMBER 18 2022 - Today I will try and add an if statement to see if distance satisfies threshold condition
- I also need to store variables like mutation rate, indel rate, and all those things so I can change them as we go
- Moved createseq.cpp function into mutations_2.cpp so I could use ran to generate the protein sequence!
- Added in correct normal deviate generator using ratio of uniforms - Not going to use box-muller method anymore, added new function in function.cpp -
  this function also comes from numerical recipes thrid edition.
- Added a lot of code into my main abcmcmc.cpp file. Added way to propose new parameter using normal deviate function which takes mean and stddev
  parameter. Wrote a loop to propose these new values and within this loop, I have a loop that mutates the protein. The function seems to working well and
today was a very productive day. I am going to push all these updates to github to keep testing
- Next steps, try to print out the vector of accepted parameter values! We need to also figure out the results, what to show, what does it mean, ask
  Brian. Read some papers to figure this out as well. What do we do with accepted parameters and how do we incorporate probability into that?
- Also start to work on the powerpoint presentation for my BEAP presentation.

November 21 2022 - Today I moved my beap presentation slide deck from my linux machine onto Brians machine and github.
- Started preparing an outline for my presentation in latex, looks pretty good actually.
- I have a few questions for Brian concerning how Im gonna collect results for this. I also still need to figure if the accepted parameters are forming a posterior
distribution
- Continue to try and get some results, get some graphs under different parameters etc WE NEED RESULTS XANDER. But also start filling out presentation now and lay the rest
of the slides down and take notes and kill this presentation.

November 22 2022 - Today I continued working on my beap presentation slides.
- Added hyperlinks in outline slide to go to the beginning of each section
- added content for my third slide, looking good, lets keep going, taking a break rn

November 23 2022 - Today I actually fixed up the changes that Brian made on my literature review
- Fixed the bibliography because Journal names were not capitalized
- OA genet for marjoram 2013 ABC article is the journal so if he asks show him that, couldnt fix it because that is the journal
- Fixed up citations where Brian said he did not suggest something first, same with Mirkin comment
- Today I will also continue working on my powerpoint, maybe try to add in algorithm slide or something. ADD LOTS OF SLIDES COME ON XANDER
