##This file will record things I have done for my thesis so far##
##I am learning c/c++ for my thesis to run an ABC-MCMC

1. Created function which takes an integer value and generates a
random amino acid sequence of that length (I used the string class
from c++ for this part)

std::string createSeq(int n){

    char aminoAcids[numAA] = { AMINO ACID SYMBOLS };

    std::string protein = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        protein =  protein + aminoAcids[rand() % numAA];}

    std::cout << protein << "\n" << "\n" ;
    //printf("%s", protien.c_str());
    return protein;
}

2. The second function I began working on reads in the SRP40
protein which acts as the data that is already known, and it
creates a vector with characteristics like the length of the
sequence, the number of LCR's in the sequence, average entropy of
the LCRs - we must use segA to determine these characteristics.
- in C, we need to figure out how to call segA and record the value
  of the output and manipulate the value of the output as well (SEP

- I have created a symbolic link to the program segA and I will use
  that when I call segA from c/c++. (SEP 19 2022)

int og_protein(){

    std::string srp40 = "SRP40 AMINO ACID SEQUENCE"

    int length = srp40.length();
    int num_lcr =
    int avg_entropy_lcr =

    std::cout << srp40 << "\n" << "\n" << length << "\n";
    return 0;

3. I created a repository on github so I could work both from home
and from the lab and push changes on both different devices (SEP 19
2022)
- always need to remember to push the changes from where I am
  working - once segA is involved, the code will only work when
running on the server
