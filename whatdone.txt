1. Created function which takes an integer value and generates a  
random amino acid sequence of that length (I used the string class
from c++ for this part) - string class allows for easy string
manipulation compared to using "an array of chars in c)                                         


std::string createSeq(int n){

    char aminoAcids[numAA] = { AMINO ACID SYMBOLS };

    std::string protein = "";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        protein =  protein + aminoAcids[rand() % numAA];}

    std::cout << protein << "\n" << "\n" ;
    //printf("%s", protein.c_str());
    return protein;
}

2. The second function I began working on reads in the SRP40
protein which acts as the data that is already known, and it
creates a vector with characteristics like the length of the
sequence, the number of LCR's in the sequence, average entropy of
the LCRs - we must use segA to determine these characteristics.
- in C, we need to figure out how to call segA and record the value
  of the output and manipulate the value of the output as well (SEP
19 2022)
- I have created a symbolic link to the program segA and I will use
  that when I call segA from c/c++. (SEP 19 2022)
- Converted srp40 protein string into fasta file, fed that fasta file to segA, figured out how many low complexity regions are in the srp40 protien sequence (SEP 20 2022) 

int og_protein(){

    std::string srp40 = "MASKKIKVDEVPKLSVKEKEIEEKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSGESSSSSSSSSSSSSSDSSDS\

    //creating fasta file of protein string to use in segA
    std::ofstream MyFile("srp40.fasta"); //Create and open a fasta file
    MyFile << ">srp40_saccharomyces_cerevisiae\n" << srp40; //Write to the file
    MyFile.close(); //Close the file

    //getting the characteristics of the sequence
    int length = srp40.length();
    system("segA srp40.fasta 15 1.9 2.2 -l | grep '>' | wc -l >> numlcr.txt"); //Write the results of counting the LCRs to a txt file
    std::ifstream myreadfile("numlcr.txt"); //Declaring fstream variable and connecting it to a stream object by opening the file
    int num_lcr; //Declare int variable which holds the contents of the 'numlcr.txt' file
    myreadfile >> num_lcr; //Pipe file's content into stream
    //int avg_entropy_lcr =

    std::cout << srp40 << "\n" << "\n" << length << "\n" << "\n"<< num_lcr << "\n" ;
    return 0;

3. I created a repository on github so I could work both from home
and from the lab and push changes on both different devices (SEP 19
2022)
- always need to remember to push the changes from where I am
  working - once segA is involved, the code will only work when
running on the server

####################################################################################################
4. The third function I am working on is the function responsible for mutating the randomly generated protein sequence (SEP 21)
- Basically I need it to iterate through each amino acid in the generated sequence and choose a random exponential deviate from the
  exponential distribution (which models waiting times between events). Once I have generated a random exponential deviate for each amino
acid in the simulated sequence, I have to select the amino acid with the lowest value and select that amino acid to mutate into another
amino acid - I repeat this process of iterating through the sequence and assigning exponential deviates and mutating the lowest value for
a lot of generations (Brian suggested 1000 generations for 100 Amino acid sequence).
- Need to figure out a way to store the deviates in the same positions as amino acids so when we find the lowest number it matches the
  amino acid position

- SEPT 22 - Today I figured out that using a c++ vector is better
than using an array because arrays in c cant change size at runtime.
Vectors on the other hand can change size at runtime so we can add
values to it while iterating through the loop - today I just used
the rand() function because I could not get ran1 working for the
exponential deviates - I have basically intialized a vector,
iterated through the length of the simulated amino acid sequence and
produced a random number for that position in the amino acid - I
store these random values in a vector which is also 0 indexed and
matches the indices of the amino acid string.

std::string mutateSeq(std::string simulated_protein){

    std::vector<double> exp_deviates_vtr ; // Creating a vector to hold the values of the deviates

    // Traversing the string
    for (int i = 0; i < simulated_protein.length(); i++) {

        // Code to apply random exponential deviates to AA
        int deviate =  rand();
        exp_deviates_vtr.push_back(deviate);
    }

    // THIS IS JUST TO PRINT THE VECTOR
    for (int x = 0; x < exp_deviates_vtr.size(); i++) {
        std::cout << x << ' ';
    }
    

    return simulated_protein;
}

5. SEPT 26 2022 - SO, mutation function got split up today into kind of 2 separate parts. Basically, we will not choose exponential deviates for
mutation, but rather choose a random poisson deviate with a mean equal to (mutation rate * # of sites) - choosing a random value from this
distribution could yield the same # of mutations as the mean, or more or less. Then we assign mutations randomly to the number of amino acids that we
get from this poisson distribution deviate. The second function will be created in order to handle amino acid expansion, and in this step we will use
exponential deviates - breaking the process up like this will save time. SIDE NOTE: We are using a poisson distribution because any kind of rare event
(like mutation rate) can be modeled by this. We will keep the function from above but modify it slightly - it will be the function that does the amino
acid expansion part
- I think I finished the function responsible for mutating the
sequence (choosing the number of mutations from a poisson
        distribution with a mean equal to the mutation rate * length
        of the sequence) - I just need to now get ran1 and the
poisson distribution in there because I am using rand() right now to
generate the sequences - CHECK ON THIS ASAP - the only thing I have
done is basically make a loop which uses the number of mutation
sites provided by the rand() function between 1-10 and changes that
- STILL WORKING ON FUNCTION TO LOOK BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN AMINO
ACID SEQUENCE TO CHECK FOR REPEATS AND ASSIGN DEVIATES (SEPT 26
        2022)

- SEPT 27 2022 - Updated code for the second mutation function.
Today I attempted to write the function which iterates through the
mutated protein sequence and assigns exponential deviates
(mutateSeqExp). Right now, the code looks for matching amino acids both upstream and
downstream the protein and the number of repeats is assessed per
amino acid. This means each amino acid is iterated through and the
same amino acids are looked for on either side of the amino
acid. The length of the repeat is then used in subsequent steps
like solving for beta = (mutation rate, length of repeat) and then
this beta value is used in the exponential distribution as the mean
- TRY TO FIND A WAY TO REMOVE BOTH COUNTERS AND JUST USE 1 COUNTER
IN mutateSeqExp - issue with counters getting incorrect values, fix
this.
- Today I also coded in the ability to scan for repeats (part 2 of the mutation function) - it is able to assign amino acids within repeats a longer length value than individual amino acids
which are not within repeats - this means we will be able to assign a random exponential deviate with a mean equal to the mutation rate times the length of the repeats. I am still having
issues with the random number generation and distribution functions, need to solve this ASAP (SEPT 27 2022)
- QUESTION (wrote in notebook as well), need to think about it - What does a larger mean, mean in terms of the exponential distribution? If I am saying to multiply the mutation rate by
the length of the repeats, this would mean a larger beta value going in as the mean of the exponential deviate, does a larger mean make a random number that will be small more likely?

- OCTOBER 3 2022 - Today I finally figured out how to implement Ran1 into my code. I have both the file that brian sent me "myRandomFunctions.c" which utilizes functions from the second edition of
  Numerical Recipes. Brian also gave me the third edition of the book which includes a newer random number generator called Ran - this one can be used as well to generate the deviates, I just need
to add the functions from numerical recipes thrid edition into the file called "functions.cpp" - I still need to add random deviate functions for normal distribution (to choose new mutation rates),
for exponential deviate function (for amino acid extension function), and poission deviates (to choose how many mutations to give my simulated protein per generation)
- So I used the functions from Numerical recipes third edition, I am trying to now test out using the poisson deviates and exponential deviates. The poisson deviates kept giving me 0 as an int
  because it was a float number but for a number of mutations should I be rounding the nearest whole number? Do I use floats or ints? I should not be getting such low numbers for my poisson deviate,
my poisson deviate is supposed to tell me how many mutations the sequence should undergo and right now I cant even get 1 mutation. FIGURE THIS OUT


//THIS FUNCTION WILL CHOOSE A RANDOM POISSON DEVIATE WITH A MEAN
//EQUAL TO (MUTATION RATE * # OF SITES) - WHATEVER THE VALUE OF THE
//RANDOM DEVIATE, CHOOSE THAT MANY MUTATIONS IN THE SEQUENCE AT

std::string mutateSeqAA(std::string simulated_protein){

    float mutation_rate = 0.14 ; // just setting mutation rate here now
    float avg_mutations = mutation_rate * simulated_protein.length() ;
    int poisson_deviate_num_mutations = (rand() % 10) + 1 ; //Choose random poisson deviate with mean = avg_mutations
    
    //This for loop will give 5 random sites mutations
    for (int i = 0; i < poisson_deviate_num_mutations; i++) {

        char aminoAcids[numAA] = { 'G', 'A', 'L', 'M', 'F', 'W', 'K', 'Q', 'E', 'S', 'P', 'V', 
                                   'I', 'C', 'Y', 'H', 'R', 'N', 'D', 'T' };
        
        char random_AA = aminoAcids[rand() % numAA]; // sets up the random amino acid, same used in first function to createSeq
        int random_site = rand() % simulated_protein.length(); // Gives random number in range (0 - length of protein sequence)
        simulated_protein[random_site] = random_AA; // indexes the simulated protein at a random spot and replaces the existing AA with a new random one

November 2 2022 - Things have been busy recently, but today I separated all
of my functions that were in one file, into their own respective file. I will also
create a Makefile to compile each of the functions for initial testing.
- createseq.cpp works on its own and produces a random sequence of amino acids - this is using the c++ rand, I think its okay in this case
- observed_protein.cpp function is still in the works but it works on its own and will be the vector of summary statistics for the observed data (srp40 right now)
- mutations.cpp contains both functions which will be used in the mutation step - I have got the first part working where a random poisson deviate is selected and
  that number is the number of amino acids to mutate - this step works, now I have to get the second function with the exponential deviates to work. (Updated code
on github)
