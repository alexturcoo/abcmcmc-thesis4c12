##########BEAP DECEMBER 2022 SCRIPT/WHAT TO SAY##############

######TITLE SLIDE######
Hello Everyone, my name is Alexander Turco and I am a fourth year thesis student in Brians lab. Before I begin I just want to say thank you to everyone in advance for making it. I also want to say how amazing it feels to be up here presenting to a crowd that I've learned so much from. 

Today I am going to be talking about how I am trying to use an Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate evolutionary parameters like mutation and indel rates for protein low complexity Regions. 

######Overview######
Before we begin heres just a little framework of some things I'm gonna touch on in this short period of time.
- I will first provide some background information on Low Complexity Regions (what defines them, how do they look, why are they important, types)
- Then I'm going to talk about some Questions that have been kind of guiding the study as well as things I'm exploring 
- Next I'll describe the approach I am using to actually answer some of those questions (Model based inference, bayesian statistics, ABC MCMC)
- And finally we will briefly touch on some results (if I have any lol) and then conclude the presentation.

######What are LCR's######
To put simply, Low complexity regions are segments of protein or DNA sequences (protein in this case on my slide) that are skewed/biased in their composition.
- if you take a look on the slide you can see three Low Complexity Regions found in the SRP40 protein from Saccharomyces Cerivisea. The SRP40 protein is serine rich and plays a role in preribosome assembly and transport and we will be mentioning it later as well.
- The reason for these numbers on the slide is to highlight the more formal definition of LCRs which is that They contain low information and have a low ENTROPY.
- So on the slide you can see a value called complexity and this value is calculated using Shannon's Entropy Equation 

######Shannon's Entropy######
Here is the equation for Shannon's Entropy shown on the slide.
- L is the number of elements, pi is the probability of occurrence, and H is the units which are measured in bits (bits because log base 2)
- This equation measures the disorder or randomness in a system and is commonly used to search for patterns and complexity in both DNA and protein sequences
- Just for better understanding, I show here two DNA sequences. One consists of all the same nucleotide (it is of minimal complexity) and once consists of each nucleotide being represented equally (maximal complexity)
- The sequence made up of all the same nucleotide has an entropy of 0 (minimum for DNA sequence) and the sequence made up of equal frequencies of each nucleotide has an entropy of 2 (maximum entropy for DNA sequence)
- So essentially the lower the entropy, the less random the sequence is and vice versa!

######LCR's Present in Unique Ways 1######
So hopefully at this point (after all the LCR presentations lol) everybody understands how LCRs are defined.
- It is also important to mention that although LCRs share an overall low diversity of amino acids or nucleotides, there are so many different ways they present this low diversity
- All the examples I am showing in the next few slides are different forms of LCRs based on amino acid periodicity but it is important to understand that not all LCRs contain patterns like these but rather they deviate from a random composition
- THe first example shown here are homorepeats - these are consecutive runs of a single residues and the reason for mentioning them is beecause of the role they play in human diseases (we will talk about that later).

######LCR's Present in Unique Ways 2######
- The second example shown are direpeats - these are consecutive runs of two ordered different residues, you can see this highlighted by the difference in color showing the different amino acids

######LCR's Present in Unique Ways 3######
- Finally we have tandem repeats. These are sequences of typically 1-6 residues that are repeated numerous times.
- Regions composed of tandem repeats are commonly called microsatellites and these are actually one of the best studied types of LCR's
- The number of repeated segments within a microsatellite sequence differs among individuals which makes these sequences interesting. This difference in the number of repeated segments makes microsatellites useful as polymorphic markers for studying inheritence patterns in families, or for creating DNA fingerprints from crime scene samples. 

######LCR's Are Hypermutable######
- So another characteristic of Low complexity regions is that they have been found to be hypermutable - meaning over evolutionary time, it is thought that they frequently gained and lost repeats
- Just to provide a little evidence for this, there was a study done using 2 different species of Drosophila (I know we have a lot of Drosophila lovers in the room so I thought this would be fitting lol). 
- Essentially the researchers performed an interspecific comparison between the mastermind gene in Drosophila Melanogaster and Drosophila Virilis which are believed to have separated approximately 60x10^6 years ago (enough time for nonessential sequences to diverge).
- The mastermind gene encodes a highly repetitive nuclear protein required for neural development. Part of this gene is highly conserved but extensive variation is noted in homopolymer domains which flank the conserved region.
- The researchers characterized these into unique and repetitive regions and discovered that repetitive regions are characterized by almost a threefold higher rate of amino acid replacement.

######Proposed Mechanisms of LCR Evolution 1######
- There are two mechanisms that have been proposed which try to explain the evolution of Low complexity regions/repetitive regions.
- The first being polymerase Slippage or Slipped Strand Mispairing - there are a lot of names for this lol.
- During replication, what can sometimes happen is that the DNA polymerase and the newwly synthesized DNA strand complex can temporarily dissociate from the template DNA
- In areas that have repetitive sequences, as shown on the slide, the polymerase may join back with the template strand in a position one or two repeats ahead or behind where it left off
- What Im showing here is just a very simple example of the polymerase slipping forward and backwards. 
- Slipping forward means the polymerase skips one of the template repeats resulting in the deletion of the repeat in the newly synthesized strand.
- Slipping backwards means the polymerase copies an extra repeat into the newly synthesized DNA strand

######Proposed Mechanisms of LCR Evolution 2######
- The second Proposed Mechanism of LCR Evolution is unequal recombination
- So what Ive shown on the slide is a simple illustration of unequal crossing over between repetitive runs on homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
- Homologous chromosomes are shown in light blue and tan, repetitive DNA strands are shown in red and green - When unequal crossing over occurs (shown on the left), it results in the reciprocal appearance of expanded and contracted repeats (shown on the right).
